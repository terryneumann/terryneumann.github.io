## About me  

I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Austin studying Information Systems, with an emphasis on **Ethical and Responsible AI**, advised by [Maria De-Arteaga](https://mariadearteaga.com/) and [Yan Leng](https://yleng.github.io/www/). Throughout my PhD, I've been fortunate to collaborate with and learn from great researchers like [Sina Fazelpour](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/sina-fazelpour/), [Matt Lease](https://mattlease.com/), and [Maytal Saar-Tsechansky](https://www.maytals.com/).  

My proposed dissertation, *Sociotechnical Controls for Mitigating AI Risk in the Absence of Ground Truth*, develops conceptual frameworks, statistical tests, and technical mitigations that help organizations anticipate and reduce risks---such as bias and uncertain ROI---when deploying AI in settings where the 'right' answer depends on human judgment and social context.

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a Data Scientist at the [University of Chicago Crime Lab](https://crimelab.uchicago.edu/), where I was fortunate to learn from great researchers like [Jens Ludwig](https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/jens-ludwig) and [Max Kapustin](https://www.maxkapustin.com/). I received a MS in Analytics from Northwestern University and a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Indiana University, Bloomington. Outside of research, I love to run, cook, go to concerts, and play the guitar.
