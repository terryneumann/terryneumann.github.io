## Welcome!  

I am a fifth-year PhD candidate researching **Responsible AI** advised by [Maria De-Arteaga](https://mariadearteaga.com/) and [Yan Leng](https://yleng.github.io/www/). My research develops methods to ensure large language models are safe, transparent, and socially beneficial. My work bridges machine learning, mechanistic interpretability, and computational social science to address pressing challenges at the intersection of AI and society. My dissertation, *Sociotechnical Controls for Mitigating AI Risk in the Absence of Ground Truth*, examines safeguards for AI systems in high-uncertainty, social contexts such as content moderation and agentic decision-making.

## Collaborators  

Iâ€™m fortunate to collaborate with and learn from great researchers like [Sina Fazelpour](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/sina-fazelpour/), [Matt Lease](https://mattlease.com/), and [Maytal Saar-Tsechansky](https://www.maytals.com/).
