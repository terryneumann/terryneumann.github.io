My paper [Should You Use LLMs to Simulate Opinions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08954) has been accepted to the **AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence!** I will update you when I hear about whether this will be a poster or presentation in the AI for Social Impact track. :sparkles: :smile: See you in Singapore this January!
