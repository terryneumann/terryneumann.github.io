## Welcome!  

I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Austin studying Information Systems, with an emphasis on **Ethical and Responsible AI**, advised by [Maria De-Arteaga](https://mariadearteaga.com/) and [Yan Leng](https://yleng.github.io/www/).

My proposed dissertation, *Sociotechnical Controls for Mitigating AI Risk in the Absence of Ground Truth*, develops conceptual frameworks, statistical tests, and technical mitigations that help organizations anticipate and reduce risks when deploying AI in settings where human judgment, social context, and technical systems intersect.

## Collaborators  

Iâ€™m fortunate to collaborate with and learn from great researchers like [Sina Fazelpour](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/sina-fazelpour/), [Matt Lease](https://mattlease.com/), and [Maytal Saar-Tsechansky](https://www.maytals.com/).
