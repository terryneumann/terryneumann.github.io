## Welcome!  

I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Austin researching how organizations can responsibly deploy AI systems in complex social contexts, advised by [Maria De-Arteaga](https://mariadearteaga.com/) and [Yan Leng](https://yleng.github.io/www/).

Across numerous social decision making contexts, such as hiring, medical diagnosis, or content moderation, there is often no objective measure of the "correct" decision, making it difficult to assess AI performance and fairness. My research develops methods to conceptualize, quantify, and mitigate AI risks in complex social contexts by drawing on research from machine learning, computational social science, ethics, and behavioral science.

My proposed dissertation, *Sociotechnical Controls for Mitigating AI Risk in the Absence of Ground Truth*, develops conceptual frameworks, statistical tests, and technical mitigations that help organizations anticipate and reduce risks when deploying AI in settings where human judgment, social context, and technical systems intersect.

## Collaborators  

Iâ€™m fortunate to collaborate with and learn from great researchers like [Sina Fazelpour](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/sina-fazelpour/), [Matt Lease](https://mattlease.com/), and [Maytal Saar-Tsechansky](https://www.maytals.com/).
