## Welcome!  

I’m a fourth-year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin, where I study **Responsible and Ethical AI** under the guidance of [Maria De-Arteaga](https://mariadearteaga.com/).  

I am both fascinated by and skeptical of advances in AI. On one hand, I’m captivated by AI’s transformative potential to reshape society and drive incredible efficiencies. On the other, I approach its rapid advancements with a critical eye, wary of the hype that often clouds meaningful discourse. This tension fuels my research, as I strive to disentangle fact from fiction and equip organizations to make informed, ethical decisions about AI adoption and development.  

## What I Work On  

In my research, I focus on:  
- **Frameworks for Responsible AI**: Designing practical theoretical frameworks to guide ethical and responsible development and use of AI technologies.  
- **Evaluating AI Behavior**: Investigating behavior and performance, especially in areas where ground truth is ambiguous or indeterminate, requiring thoughtful methods and theoretical considerations beyond traditional empirical approaches.  
- **Mitigating AI Risks**: Identifying and addressing problematic behaviors in AI systems to improve their safety and reliability.  

## Collaborators  

I’m fortunate to collaborate with and learn from great researchers like [Sina Fazelpour](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/sina-fazelpour/), [Matt Lease](https://mattlease.com/), and [Maytal Saar-Tsechansky](https://www.maytals.com/).
