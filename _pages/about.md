## About me  

I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Austin studying Information Systems, advised by [Maria De-Arteaga](https://mariadearteaga.com/) and [Yan Leng](https://yleng.github.io/www/). Throughout my PhD, I've been fortunate to collaborate with and learn from great researchers like [Sina Fazelpour](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/sina-fazelpour/), [Matt Lease](https://mattlease.com/), and [Maytal Saar-Tsechansky](https://www.maytals.com/).  

My research focuses on **trustworthy AI**. I am particularly interested in the following research streams: (1) mechanistic interpretability of LLM agents, (2) responsible use of LLMs as silicon subjects for academic and social applications, and (3) algorithmic fairness on social media. I pursue research that bridges machine learning and computational social science to address pressing challenges at the intersection of AI and society.

Above: I have found the [NIST AI Risk Management Framework's Characteristics of Trustworthy AI](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework) as a valuable framework for scoping and defining my contributions. Click on a characteristic to explore my work in that area.

## Background

My path to academia included working as a Data Scientist at the [University of Chicago Crime Lab](https://crimelab.uchicago.edu/), where I was fortunate to collaborate with exceptional researchers [Jens Ludwig](https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/jens-ludwig) and [Max Kapustin](https://www.maxkapustin.com/). Prior to that, I received a MS in Analytics from Northwestern University and a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Indiana University, Bloomington. Outside of research, I love to run (I ran [my first 50k in 2024](https://gobeyondracing.com/races/stumptown-trail-runs/)), cook, go to concerts, and play the guitar.
