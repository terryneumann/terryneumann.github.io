## Welcome!  

I am a fifth-year PhD candidate researching **Responsible AI** advised by [Maria De-Arteaga](https://mariadearteaga.com/) and [Yan Leng](https://yleng.github.io/www/). My research develops methods to make large language models safer, more transparent, and socially beneficial, drawing on techniques and theories from machine learning, mechanistic interpretability, and computational social science. My proposed dissertation, *Sociotechnical Controls for Mitigating AI Risk in the Absence of Ground Truth*, advances safeguards for high-uncertainty, social applications of large language models such as content moderation and agentic decision-making.

## Collaborators  

Iâ€™m fortunate to collaborate with and learn from great researchers like [Sina Fazelpour](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/sina-fazelpour/), [Matt Lease](https://mattlease.com/), and [Maytal Saar-Tsechansky](https://www.maytals.com/).
